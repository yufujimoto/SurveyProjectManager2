# Summary

Survey Project Manager II (SPM-II) has been developed to manage various kinds of digital archiving projects in accordance with the International Stadards. In addition to this aim, this system enables users to practice “Work-Oriented” approach in digital archiving projects. By using this system, users can manage digital archiving projects and outcums on the online server. Although Survey Project Manager is previously developed by using PHP and Javascripts (SPM-I), this system is currently developed by using Ruby on Rails in this version. 

SPM-II is deeply related to the “Survey Data Collector (SDC)”, which is the offline digital archiving system. SDC is originaly developed as a tethering system for Sony A6000 and A6300, and lately extended as the total digital archiving system managing various kinds of digital data in combination with the database. The ideal workflow is that users collect and/or manage digitally archived outcomes on SDC and integrate these datasets on the SPM-II to share and/or publish their resultants.
